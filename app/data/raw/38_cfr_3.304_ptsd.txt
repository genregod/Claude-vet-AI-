38 CFR § 3.304 — Direct service connection; wartime and peacetime.

(f) Post-traumatic stress disorder.

Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder requires medical
evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with § 4.125(a) of this
chapter; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms
and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the
claimed in-service stressor occurred. The following provisions apply to
claims for service connection of post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosed
during service or at any time after discharge from active service:

(1) If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with
the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the
absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided
that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions,
or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone
may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

(2) If the evidence establishes that the veteran was a prisoner of war
under the provisions of § 3.1(y) of this part and the claimed stressor
is related to that prisoner of war experience, in the absence of clear
and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed
stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships
of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish
the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

(3) If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear
of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or
psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has
contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a
diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and that the veteran's
symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear
and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor
is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's
service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence
of the claimed in-service stressor. For purposes of this paragraph,
"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity" means that a veteran
experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance
that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat
to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an
actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded
explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade;
small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly
military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance
involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear,
helplessness, or horror.

(4) If the evidence establishes that the veteran experienced a personal
assault during service, evidence from sources other than the veteran's
service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor
incident. Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to:
records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental
health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or
tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family
members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.
