BOARD OF VETERANS' APPEALS

DECISION

Docket No. [REDACTED]
Date: [REDACTED]

ISSUE: Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

FINDING OF FACT:
The Veteran served on active duty from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], including
service in Southwest Asia. The Veteran's military occupational specialty
(MOS) was consistent with exposure to hostile military activity.

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD made by a VA psychologist in
accordance with DSM-5 criteria. The examining psychologist opined that
the Veteran's PTSD is at least as likely as not related to the Veteran's
reported in-service stressors involving fear of hostile military activity.

The claimed stressors are consistent with the places, types, and
circumstances of the Veteran's service, as shown by the Veteran's service
records and personnel file.

CONCLUSION OF LAW:
The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C.
§§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f)(3).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION:

The Veteran contends that PTSD developed as a result of in-service
experiences during deployment to Southwest Asia. Specifically, the
Veteran reports exposure to incoming mortar fire, improvised explosive
devices (IEDs), and small arms fire while on convoy missions.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3), if a claimed stressor is related to the
veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, and a VA
psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is
adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD, the veteran's lay testimony
alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.

The Board finds that the evidence satisfies all three elements required
for service connection for PTSD:

1. A current medical diagnosis of PTSD conforming to DSM-5 criteria;
2. A medical nexus linking the current PTSD to the in-service stressor;
3. Credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.

The benefit of the doubt has been resolved in favor of the Veteran.
38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

ORDER:
Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is GRANTED.
