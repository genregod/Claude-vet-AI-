M21-1, Part I, Chapter 5 — Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Procedures

Section A: Overview of the Appeals Modernization Act

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), effective February 19, 2019, replaced
the legacy appeals system with three decision review lanes that give
claimants more choice and control over the review of their claims:

1. Supplemental Claim Lane (VA Form 20-0995)
   A claimant who disagrees with a VA decision may file a Supplemental Claim
   by submitting new and relevant evidence. The agency of original
   jurisdiction (AOJ) will readjudicate the claim considering all evidence
   of record. There is no time limit to file a Supplemental Claim as long
   as new and relevant evidence is submitted.

   Key requirements:
   - The claimant must submit or identify new and relevant evidence.
   - "New" evidence is evidence not previously part of the record.
   - "Relevant" evidence tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue.
   - The duty to assist applies in the Supplemental Claim lane.

2. Higher-Level Review Lane (VA Form 20-0996)
   A claimant may request a Higher-Level Review (HLR) within one year of
   the decision being reviewed. A senior reviewer (Decision Review Officer)
   will conduct a de novo review of the same evidence that was before the
   AOJ at the time of the prior decision.

   Key characteristics:
   - No new evidence may be submitted by the claimant.
   - The reviewer may identify a duty to assist error that must be corrected.
   - An informal conference may be requested but is not required.
   - The effective date is preserved if the HLR is filed within one year.

3. Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (VA Form 10182)
   A claimant may appeal directly to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA).
   Three docket options are available:

   a. Direct Review — The Board reviews the existing record with no new
      evidence and no hearing. This is the fastest Board docket.

   b. Evidence Submission — The claimant may submit additional evidence
      within 90 days of filing the appeal. No hearing is held.

   c. Hearing Request — The claimant may request a hearing before a
      Veterans Law Judge and may submit evidence within 90 days following
      the hearing.

Section B: Filing Deadlines and Effective Dates

- Supplemental Claim: No deadline, but the effective date depends on when
  new and relevant evidence is received.
- Higher-Level Review: Must be filed within one year of the decision.
- Board Appeal: Must be filed within one year of the decision.
- If a claimant continuously pursues a claim through one of the AMA lanes
  within one year of each decision, the effective date may be preserved
  back to the original date of claim.

Section C: Duty to Assist

Under the AMA, the duty to assist applies in the Supplemental Claim lane
and on remand from the Board. It does not apply in the Higher-Level Review
lane or during Board proceedings (except on remand).
