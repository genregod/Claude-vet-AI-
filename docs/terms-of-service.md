**Effective Date:** [DATE]
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

## Agreement to Terms

By creating an account or using Valor Assist ("the Service"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

---

## What Valor Assist Does

Valor Assist is an AI-powered platform that helps U.S. military veterans understand VA disability claims, appeals, discharge upgrades, and military records corrections. The Service uses a knowledge base of publicly available legal texts and an AI assistant to provide regulation-cited guidance.

---

## Important Disclaimers

**Valor Assist provides legal information, not legal advice.** The Service is not a law firm, does not employ attorneys on your behalf, and does not create an attorney-client relationship. The guidance provided is based on publicly available regulations, statutes, and case law. It is intended to help you understand your options, not to replace the judgment of a qualified attorney or accredited Veterans Service Officer.

**Valor Assist does not provide medical advice.** The Service may reference medical conditions, diagnostic codes, and treatment information in the context of VA disability ratings. This is not medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical decisions. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911. For the Veterans Crisis Line, call 988 and press 1.

**No guarantee of outcomes.** We cannot guarantee that following guidance from Valor Assist will result in a favorable claims decision, rating increase, successful appeal, or any other specific outcome. VA decisions depend on many factors outside our control, including the evidence in your specific case and the judgment of VA adjudicators.

## Eligibility

The Service is available to U.S. military veterans, active-duty service members, members of the National Guard and Reserves, and eligible dependents and survivors. You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. Identity verification through ID.me may be required to access certain features.

## Your Account

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. Do not share your password with anyone. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately at [SUPPORT EMAIL].

## How We Use VA Data

If you choose to connect your VA.gov account, you authorize Valor Assist to access the specific categories of data you consent to through VA.gov's OAuth2 authorization screen. This may include your disability rating, service history, claims status, medical conditions, and medications.

This data is:

- Used only to provide you with personalized claims guidance during your active session
- Encrypted immediately upon receipt using Fernet symmetric encryption (AES-128-CBC)
- Held only in encrypted in-memory session state — never saved to disk or a database
- Permanently destroyed when your session ends or you log out
- Never sold, shared with marketers, or used for advertising

You may revoke VA.gov access at any time through your profile settings or directly through VA.gov.
